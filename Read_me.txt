Hi ! this software is made by an USITian(if you haven't heard of this college then don't worry 99% of the people are with you).
Well , personally I made this software for my Father as he is a property dealer and all the design and requirements
are somewhat biased to my personal use.
Now coming to the usage of software:
1. Date to be enterd in format: yyyy-m-d for eg : 2015-2-2 means 2 feb 2015.
2. Image has been saved as path : so please make sure once you have enterd the path , do not delete or move the image.
3. To identify each record uniquely , Id is automatically created , so you don't need to enter it,
but if you want to view an associated image or delete or modify , then you need to know its Id, which can be
done by 
3.1. search button ,
3.2. View all records button
4. Whole Software is case-insensitive that means Gagan and GAGAN are same names.
5. Well you can have each and everything similar as a reocord but what makes it unique is it's ID.
Requirements:
I personally dont know but i have created this with Windows 10 (4 gb ram , 1 tb Hdd) and also tested on
Windows 8.1(2 gb ram and 512 gd Hdd)
All the Softwares must be up to date but i dont' think its manadatory.
