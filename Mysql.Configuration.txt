Configuring Mysql:
Well , You need mysql server (mine is 5.7) and also to see what goes behind the curtains you need to have MySQL Workbench(mine is 5.2 CE ).
Obviously JDK installed with environment variables set.
mysql-connector-java-5.1.38 is also required (but if you are ruuning as exectuable jar file , then this library is automatically included in it).
If you want to run as source code in your own IDE then ADD above connector jar file in your working project in IDE.
Installation of above mentioned softwares is easy , simple and could be done by youtube videos.
After that,
You need to set ,
Username for mysql as : root
Password for same as: root
(in case you have different username and password , you could change the souce code , you just have to change the instance variables in LoadJdbcDriver class
There you would find two fields as username and password , just change them).
After that, you workimg database should be "gagan"(Without quotes)(in case your database is different either create this or change the source code and that could be done by line :23.
There in the db_url just change the "gagan" to "your_database_name")
There You should create a table named as "propertydeal"
and columns should be:
person_name as varchar(20)
address as varchar(50)
id as int
deal_date as date
rent as int
area as varchar(20)
phone_number as long
image_path as varchar(150)
Please note : Order in which these columns should be made are fixed as source code is using these orders.
After That You Are Good To Go.
To use the software Read "Read me.txt".
